\section{Bioinformatics}
\label{sec:bioinfo}

Bioinformatics is a field applying computational methods for addressing biological challenges.
This is of especial interest in areas where the amount of biological data is so large that other means of processing the data is infeasible.
One prominent area of biology where this is the case is sequence analysis, where huge amounts of DNA sequences are analyzed to understand biological phenomena or make useful predictions.

In this section we study such a bioinformatics application, called T-CUP~\cite{DybowskiHeHo2010}, concerned with predicting the resistance of a patient to certain types of \HIV drugs.
T-CUP uses machine learning as a statistical method to build a model based on millions of analyzed DNA sequences.
Based on this model the software can predict the resistance of a patient to a particular type of \HIV drugs which is of obvious practical use when determine which drugs to use for treating the patient.
T-CUP is designed to replace an expensive and time-consuming blood analysis which is currently used.

\subsection*{Biological Background}
There exists three classes of \HIV viruses, called R5, X4 and X4R5.
The names relate to the co-receptors the virus uses to connect to the host cell it infects:
the R5 virus uses the {\small CCR5} co-receptor, the X4 virus the {\small CXCR4} co-receptor, and the X4R5 virus uses both.
\autoref{fig:hiv} shows a cell with the co-receptors.

Certain HIV drugs work by blocking the {\small CCR5} co-receptor and, thus, make it unavailable for the HIV virus.
Obviously, these drugs are only effective against the R5 and X4R5 types of the HIV virus.
It is, therefore, of interest when choosing the appropriate drug for treating a patient with which type of HIV virus the patient is infected.
There exists a blood test which can be used to determine the HIV virus type.
Unfortunately is this test expensive and time-consuming, so that often the treatment starts before the results of the test are known.

\subsection*{T-CUP}
The T-CUP software attempts to predict the type of the HIV virus from analyzing a large amount of DNA sequences.
