\section{Experimental Setup}

\from{HIPS begin}
\subsection{HIPS}
We developed implementations of two application case studies using the SkelCL library:
1) the calculation of a Mandelbrot fractal as a simple benchmark application, and, 2) a real-world algorithm for medical image reconstruction.
In this section, both implementations are compared to similar implementations in CUDA and OpenCL regarding programming effort and runtime performance.

For our runtime experiments we use a common PC with a quad-core CPU (Intel Xeon E5520, 2.26\,GHz) and 12\,GB of memory.
The system is connected to a Tesla S1070 computing system equipped with 4 Tesla GPUs.
Its dedicated 16\,GB of memory (4\,GB per GPU) is accessed with up to 408\,GB/s (102\,GB/s per GPU).
Each GPU comprises 240 streaming processor cores running at up to 1.44\,GHz.
