% Chapter 4: Application Studies
\chapter{Application Studies}
\label{chapter:skelcl-evaluation}

In this chapter we present various application studies evaluating the usefulness and performance of the abstractions introduced by the \SkelCL programming model which were presented in the previous chapter.
We start with a brief discussion of the metrics used to evaluate the \SkelCL programming model and discuss the experimental setup used throughout the chapter.
We will then look at applications from a wide range of application domains ranging from simple benchmark applications like the computation of the Mandelbrot set, over linear algebra and image processing applications, to real-world applications in medical imaging, physics, and biology.

For all application source codes using the \SkelCL library presented in this section we only show relevant code sections and omit implementation details like initializing \SkelCL, including the correct set of header files, and prefix names defined within the \code{skelcl} namespace.
