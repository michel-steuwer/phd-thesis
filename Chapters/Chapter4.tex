% Chapter 4: Application Studies
\chapter{Application Studies}
\label{chapter:skelcl-evaluation}

In this chapter we present various application studies evaluating the usefulness and performance of the abstractions introduced by the \SkelCL programming model which was presented in the previous section.
We start with a brief discussion of the experimental setup used throughout the chapter and discuss the metrics used to evaluate the \SkelCL programming model.
We will then look at applications from a wide range of application domains ranging from simple benchmark applications like the computation of the Mandelbrot set, over linear algebra and image processing applications, to real-world applications in medical imaging, physics, and biology.

For all application source codes using the \SkelCL library which are presented in this section we only show relevant sections and omit implementation details like initializing \SkelCL, including the correct set of header files, and prefix names with the \code{skelcl} namespace.
