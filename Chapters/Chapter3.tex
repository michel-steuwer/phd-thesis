\chapter{High-Level Programming for Multi-GPU Systems}

\label{chapter:skelcl}

In this chapter we address the first main challenge identified in \autoref{chapter:background}: Programmability of modern parallel systems.
We will see how structured parallel programming significantly simplifies the task of programming for parallel systems.
As throughout the thesis, we will focus on programming of single- and multi-\GPU systems.
But many observations made here are also valid when programming other parallel systems.

We will first motivate the need for high-level abstractions using a real-world \OpenCL application from the field of medical imaging.
Then we introduce the \emph{\SkelCL} programming model and its implementation as a \Cpp library which addresses the lack of high-level abstractions in state-of-the-art \GPU programming models.
The following \autoref{chapter:skelcl-evaluation} will provide several application studies to thoroughly evaluate the usefulness and performance of the abstractions and implementation presented in this chapter.
